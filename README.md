Data-Analyze5-Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon
Project Overview

This project investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. Create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. It then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, interpret results in terms of hypotheses.

Statistics is a major component of data analysis. Understanding statistics allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a critical consumer of analyses that others perform, as well as the conclusions they have drawn.

This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

    How to identify components of an experiment
    How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
    How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
